--Project Description:
A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external Pokemon API and enables the viewing of Pokemon data 
points in detail.

--Project Dependencies:
-Bootstrap 
-JavaScript
-Must follow ESLint rules
-Pokemon API - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

My role for this project was as a student developer, and I was faced with many
tasks while putting this application together, including digesting hours of 
study material to learn the basics of JavaScript while fulfilling assignments 
to help better understand these concepts that I would implement into this very app.

Despite its simplicity, this project was challenging, given the pace and 
sheer amount of material to cover, and the tact I used was to read sources
beyond the course material to better explain certain concepts, even utilizing 
chatGPT to break down the code step by step to help cover more ground. Knowing 
what I know now, I plan to return to studying functions in-depth, as this was 
the most significant hangup in completing this app promptly.

Throughout creating this app, I believe I developed a base foundation for 
JavaScript, though I admit it will take more practice before I can call on these
concepts without having to reference other material constantly. That being said,
this task gave me a great deal of practice in research, troubleshooting, and the 
utilization of AI to assist with my learning.
